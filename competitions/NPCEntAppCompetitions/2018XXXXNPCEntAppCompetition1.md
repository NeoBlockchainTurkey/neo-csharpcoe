1. Best Enterprise Distributed Application Prize - 3 prizes
2. Azure Enterprise Distributed Application Prize - 1 prize
3. Developers Choice Awards: Best Reusable Entity - 10 prizes

**Category 1. Best Enterprise Distributed Application Prize** 

   Juried competition to choose the best 3 Enterprise Distributed Applications built with Microsoft Visual Studio, .NET, C# and the NEO Persistable Classes Platform on the NEO Blockchain.

   * Prizes will be awarded for first place, second place, and third place.

      | Prize | Value |
      | ----- | ----- |
      | First place | USD$5000 |
      | Second place | USD$3000 |
      | Third place | USD$1000 |

   * The Best Enterprise Distributed Application Prize is independent of the other competition categories. A project is required to make a separate submission for each category. It is possible for a project to win in multiple categories.

   * Submissions will be independently voted on and selected by three (3) Enterprise Distributed Application specialists.
   
   * Submissions will be judged based on, but not limited to, the following criteria: 
      
      a) Originality

      b) Potential for re-use and sharing of the application's components across multiple projects (Reusable Entities as well as client-side patterns, entities, protocols, shared data, and other artifacts) - including actual reuse and sharing of Reusable Entities by other project submissions to this competition.
      
      c) Quality of your project's code, documentation, and videos

 **Category 1. Best Enterprise Distributed Application Prize - Submission Requirements**
   
   a. For Reusable Entity development, your project must use Microsoft Visual Studio, .NET, C#, and the NEO Persistable Classes Platform (NPC Compiler) to create each Reusable Entity class.

   b. Your project's client application and smart contract(s) must use *at least three (3) different Reusable Entity classes*.
   
   c. Your project can develop its own entities and/or re-use existing Reusable Entities found in the NPC Reusable Entity Gallery [TODO]. Your project can partner with other projects to share entities, functionality, deployed Reusable Entity/smart contracts (including shared smart data). One Reusable Entity will be supplied in advance: `NPCCounter`. Use of `NPCounter` is optional.

   d. The Reusable Entities for your distributed application must be deployed on [NEO `testnet`](https://neo.org/testnet?culture=en-us). You can use any .NET technology for your client-side application: ASP.NET, WinForms, WPF, Windows Console Application, Windows Service, Azure Web Jobs, etc. You can host and deploy your client-side application anywhere that is publicly accessible/runnable by the judges.

   e. Reusable Entities must use NEO Persistable Classes Platform features; for example, your Reusable Entities/smart contracts cannot directly call `Storage.Put()` or `Storage.Get()`.

   f. All source code created for your submission must be [MIT Licensed](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/MIT) to be license-compatible witth other NEO projects.

   g. **NOTE:** Re-use and sharing of Reusable Entities by other competition project submissions is *encouraged*.

   **Category 2. Azure Enterprise Distributed Application Prize** 

   Juried competition to choose the best Enterprise Distributed Application deployed on Microsoft Azure using Microsoft Visual Studio, .NET, C# and the NEO Persistable Classes Platform on the NEO Blockchain.

   One or more of your enterprise distributed application's software tiers must be deployed on Microsoft Azure.

   * There is one (1) Azure Enterprise Distributed Application Prize.

      | Prize | Value |
      | ----- | ----- |
      | First place | USD$5000 |

   * The Azure Enterprise Distributed Application Prize is independent of the other competition categories. A project is required to make a separate submission for each category. It is possible for a project to win in multiple categories.
   
   * Submissions will be independently voted on and selected by three (3) or more members of the the Microsoft Azure, Visual Studio and .NET product teams.

   * Submissions will be judged based on, but not limited to, the following criteria: 
      
      a) Leveraging the value-added [Microsoft Azure Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/) such as Database, Web and Mobile, Analytics, AI and Machine Learning, Internet of Things, Enterprise Integration, Security and Identity, and Monitoring and Management.

      b) Leveraging the base [Microsoft Azure Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/) such as Compute, Storage, Containers, and Networking. 
      
      c) Clarity of your project's code, documentation, and videos in terms of how your submission leverages Microsoft Azure Services.

 **Category 2. Azure Enterprise Distributed Application Prize - Submission Requirements**
   
   a. Your submission to this category must also satisfy the Category 1 submission requirements.

   b. In addition to the Category 1 submission requirements, one or more of your distributed application's software tiers must be deployed on Microsoft Azure and use one or more [Microsoft Azure Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/).

**Category 3: Developers Choice Awards: Best Reusable Entity** 

   * NPC Reusable Entities will be voted on by all members of the projects that enter a submission to any category of this competition.

   * The ten (10) Reusable Entities with the most votes will each win one prize.

      | Prize | Value |
      | ----- | ----- |
      | 10 prizes | USD$100 each |

   * The Developers Choice Awards: Best Reusable Entity is independent of the other competition categories. A project is required to make a separate submission for each category. It is possible for a project to win in multiple categories.

   * A project can submit multiple, separate, different Reusable Entities to this category. A project can win more than one Best Reusable Entity prize.

   * When voting for the Best Reusable Entity, developers are asked to keep the following criteria in mind: 
      
      a) Originality

      b) Potential re-use of an entity across multiple project (smart contract patterns, entities, protocols, shared data, and other artifacts) - including actual reuse and sharing of Reusable Entities by other project submissions to this competition.
      
      c) Quality of the entity's code, documentation, and videos

**Category 3: Developers Choice Awards: Best Reusable Entity -  Submission Requirements**
   
   a. For Reusable Entity/smart contract development, your project must use Microsoft Visual Studio, .NET, C# and the NEO Persistable Classes Platform (NPC Compiler) to create each Reusable Entity class.

   b. Each of your Reusable Entity's methods must successfully and reliably execute using 10 NeoGas (GAS) or less.
   
   c. If you want to submit a Reusable Entity without developing a submission for the competition categories, this is possible as long as another Enterprise Distributed Application project uses your Reusable Entity as part of its submission.

   d. Reusable Entities must use NEO Persistable Classes Platform features; for example, your Reusable Entities/smart contracts cannot directly call `Storage.Put()` or `Storage.Get()`.

   e. Reusable Entities submitted as part of a submission to the other competition categories must be submitted separately to the Developers Choice Awards: Best Reusable Entity category.

   f. All source code created for your submission must be [MIT Licensed](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/MIT) to be license-compatible with other NEO projects.
