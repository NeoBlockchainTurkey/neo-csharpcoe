## The NEO Blockchain: The Enterprise Distributed Applications Platform Enabled by .NET and C#

* The NEO Blockchain is an open source, programmable blockchain platform for enterprise distributed applications.
* All of the NEO Blockchain core infrastructure components as well as the NEO developer tool suite are written entirely using .NET, C# and Visual Studio including:

  * NEO Consensus Node
  * NEO Virtual Machine
  * NEO Transcompiler
  * NEO Source-code Level Debugger
  * NEO Source-code Level Execution Cost Profiler
  * NEO Developer's Wallet
  * NEO Smart Contract Visual Studio Extension
  * NEO Persistable Classes (NPC) Platform

* In addition to .NET, C#, and Visual Studio being used to implement the platform's core infrastructure components and developer tools, C# is the reference language for developing smart contracts deployed on the NEO Blockchain.  Other languages such as Python, Java, JavaScript, and Golang are also supported for smart contract development.

* The NEO Blockchain is currently the #2 programmable blockchain platform. However, Ethereum, the #1 programmable blockchain platform, has show-stopping limitations in terms of scalability, performance, and capability from an enterprise distributed applications platform perspective. These are exemplified by the following quotations:

  > The Ethereum community, key developers and researchers and others have always recognized scalability as perhaps the single most important key technical challenge that needs to be solved in order for blockchain applications to reach mass adoption. Blockchain scalability is difficult primarily because a typical blockchain design requires every node in the network to process every transaction, which limits the transaction processing capacity of the entire system to the capacity of a single node.[[Ethereum scalability research and development subsidy programs, Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum Founder, January 2, 2018](https://blog.ethereum.org/2018/01/02/ethereum-scalability-research-development-subsidy-programs/)]

  > Ethereum is a *one-trick pony x 1500* because the Solidity language used for developing Ethereum smart contracts is only able to represent a simple, single entity per smart contract. [[NEO Blockchain Vancouver Meetup Kick-off Presentation, Slide 59, Michael Herman, March 16, 2018](https://github.com/mwherman2000/neo-csharpcoe/tree/master/events/2018-NEO-Blockchain-Vancouver)]

  * C#, using the NEO Persistable Classes Platform, is the only smart contract development environment capable of supporting efficient, enterprise-class distributed application development.

## Driving a Resurgence in Enterprise Adoption of Microsoft Azure, .NET, Visual Studio and C#

* Millennials have demonstrated a high attraction to blockchain investing and trading. [[CNBC: Cryptocurrencies are the 'greatest opportunity' to get millennials to trade: TD Ameritrade](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/08/cryptocurrencies-are-the-greatest-opportunity-to-get-millennials-to-trade-td-ameritrade.html)]

* Millennials Developers, as a category, have a huge attraction to blockchain software development. [[ComputerWorld: Blockchain jobs continue to explode, offer salary premiums](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3235972/it-careers/blockchain-jobs-continue-to-explode-offer-salary-premiums.html)]

   >Blockchain development is the second-hottest skill in the job market today, growing more than 200% since this time last year.

### *First Mover Advantage in a New Market*: Blockchain Distributed Applications Development

* Blockchain development, specifically distributed applications and smart contract development, is a new innovator/early adopter market for developers and partners as well as enterprise organizations.  This represents a huge *first mover advantage* opportunity for .NET and C# by supporting and leveraging the NEO Blockchain as a platform - attracting: a) more developers, b) more partners, and c) more organizations and customers to the Microsoft ecosystem.

   ![The Technology Adoption Curve](./images/TheTechAdoptionCurveHighlighted.png)

* In addition, Microsoft can be *first to market* with a defined category of blockchain distributed applications in the [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store).

### *The Best Enterprise Blockchain Platform* developed entirely on .NET

* As reiterated previously, the NEO Blockchain is the only programmable blockchain platform that written entirely in .NET and C# using Visual Studio.  This has multiple benefits:

   * C# is the reference language for developing smart contracts deployed on the NEO Blockchain. Visual Studio is the reference IDE for smart contract development. [[NEO Blockchain C# Developers Center of Excellence: NEO Blockchain Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers](https://github.com/mwherman2000/neo-dotnetquickstart/blob/master/README.md)]

   * .NET, C#, and Visual Studio are the tools used to create all of the NEO Blockchain's core components and all of these are open source projects on GitHub. This means that the same .NET, C# and Visual Studio skills and experience used to create NEO smart contracts can also be used to read, understand, and contribute to the NEO core components. For example, the NEO VM's `Execution Engine` is a straight-forward C# class that can be self-hosted in **any** .NET application very simply - even, non-blockchain applications. [[The Neo Project (neo-project)](https://github.com/neo-project)]

   * The NEO core infrastructure components and developer tool suite (and their corresponding open source projects) can be found on [GitHub](http:github):

     * NEO Consensus Node ([neo-cli](https://github.com/neo-project/neo-cli))
     * NEO Virtual Machine ([neo-vm](https://github.com/neo-project/neo-vm))
     * NEO Transcompiler ([neo-compiler](https://github.com/neo-project/neo-compiler))
     * NEO Source-code Level Debugger ([neo-debugger-tools](https://github.com/CityOfZion/neo-debugger-tools))
     * NEO Source-code Level Execution Cost Profiler ([neo-debugger-tools](https://github.com/CityOfZion/neo-debugger-tools))
     * NEO Developer's Wallet ([neo-gui-developer](https://github.com/CityOfZion/neo-gui-developer))
     * NEO Smart Contract Visual Studio Extension ([neo-devpack-dotnet](https://github.com/neo-project/neo-devpack-dotnet))
     * NEO Persistable Classes (NPC) Platform ([neo-persistableclasses](https://github.com/mwherman2000/neo-persistableclasses/blob/master/README.md))

### *The Best Blockchain Developer Tool Suite*

* .NET, C#, Visual Studio, and the NEO Smart Contract Visual Studio Extension is the best developer tool suite for creating smart contracts - including seamless integration with the NEO Debugger.

* NEO was very smart in its integration with the Microsoft .NET compiler stack. NEO smart contract developers build what is essentially a Windows console application with `Main` method prototype that  typically looks something like:

   ```csharp
   public static Object Main(string operation, params object[] args)
   ```

  `Main` can take virtually any parameters and return any parameters (including simple types, an instance of a class, an array of instances of a class) - the above  prototype is a common pattern.

* As in conventional C# development, `Main` can instantiate instances of additional classes and call their methods to perform work on the NEO Blockchain - on behalf of an off-chain client or server-side application. 

* Smart contracts are built as plain-old C# class projects. The NEO Compiler is then run as a post-build step to transcompile MSIL patterns from a standard .NET assembly (DLL file) into a .AVM NEO VM byte code file.

* All of the features of the Visual Studio IDE and .NET/C# environment are available for NEO smart contract development - including, for example, the .NET/C# optimizing compiler features which have been demonstrated to reduce NEO VM execution costs by as much as 25% to 50%. This is a key capability because every NEO VM instruction executed during a smart contract invocation is tracked and accounted for. [[NEO System Fees](http://docs.neo.org/en-us/sc/systemfees.html)].

### *Enterprise Distributed Applications and Smart Data*: Only enabled by .NET and C#

What is unique about Enterprise Distributed Application development on a blockchain?  ...the NEO Blockchain or any other blockchain.

* While people talk mostly about *smart contracts* in the context of programmable blockchain development, it is really about *Smart Data* living on the public Internet (as well as private networks and consortium networks) - Smart Data that is both trustful and trustless.  
* Trustful because when a transaction has been confirmed on the NEO Blockchain, the Smart Data is recorded there forever: unchangeable and irrefutable. 
* Trustless because once confirmed on the blockchain, the Smart Data is digitally signed and completely decentralized ...free of any centralized control.
* The only way to place data on the NEO Blockchain is to write a smart contract that will, via a NEO transaction, store the data on the blockchain for you. 
* Every placement of data (i.e. C# entities) on the NEO Blockchain is wrapped in the code of the distributed application's smart contract. NEO smart contracts are digitally signed and deployed in the same way Smart Data is digitally signed and confirmed into the NEO Blockchain.

* To learn more, checkout the [NEO Whitepaper](http://docs.neo.org/en-us/).

### Large Base of Current as well as Prospective .NET and C# Developers

>The large base of .NET and C# Developers = Huge opportunity to drive a Resurgence in the Enterprise Adoption of Microsoft Azure, .NET, Visual Studio and C#.

* Incremental technology education, training, and adoption

* There are several million .NET developers worldwide - possibly close to 10 million in 2018.

   * >There are roughly 6 million professional developers worldwide, about 90% of whom target Windows. 4-5 million of those 6 million developers targeting Windows are Visual Basic developers. There are about 2.5 mln .NET developers. More than 60% of the Fortune 100 develop using .NET. Forrester says that 56% of enterprises in North America are choosing .NET for their development requirements vs. 44% choosing J2EE. 
   [[.NET developer statistics - a word from Microsoft, July 19, 2004](http://www.zdnet.com/article/net-developer-statistics-a-word-from-microsoft/)]

   * >There are 3.1 million monthly active developers across all Microsoft products as of August 2016, of which 1.5 million C++ developers using Visual Studio and over 2 million .net developers (including C# of course), according to Amanda Silver.
   [[MSDN: How Many Developers Use C++ vs. C# vs. Other Programming Languages, October 24, 2016](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/zxue/2016/10/24/how-many-developers-use-c-vs-c-vs-other-programming-languages/)]

* C# does not rank high on most programming language surveys - typically, 5th place or less = an opportunity to grow and increase developer adoption and satisfaction of the .NET, C# and Visual Studio platform. See [Appendix B - Popularity of the C# Programming Language](https://github.com/mwherman2000/neo-csharpcoe/blob/master/competitions/NPCEntAppCompetitions/DrivingDotNetResurgenceWithNEOBlockchain.md#appendix-b---popularity-of-the-c-programming-language).

## Call to Action

* Support increased adoption of the NEO Blockchain as *the* .NET/C#/Visual Studio enabled enterprise distributed application platform

   * New developers (Millennials Developers) are attracted to blockchain development; both smart contract development as well as full-stack distributed application development.  They are agile and flexible - willing to quickly learn and apply new technologies and new platforms ...and their adoption is faster than any previous generation.
   * Blockchain development is the new *shiny ball* for developers.
   * Enterprise-class distributed application development has been impossible on first generation blockchain platforms (e.g. Bitcoin) and very difficult on second generation blockchain platforms (e.g. Ethereum).
   * Third generation blockchain platforms (i.e. the NEO Blockchain) for the first time are providing blockchain developers with the flexibility and power needed to model their Smart Data their way and not be restricted by programming environments like Ethereum/Solidity that hobble developers with unnecessary restraints (aka [*training wheels*](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6380122600697319425/)).

   The NEO Blockchain, together with the Microsoft .NET, C#, and Visual Studio platform, is the first and only blockchain platform to support enterprise-class distributed application development on a blockchain.
