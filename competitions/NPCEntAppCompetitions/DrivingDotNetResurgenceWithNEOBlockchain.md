## Background: NEO Blockchain as an Enterprise .NET and C# Platform

* The NEO Blockchain is an open source platform project for enterprise distributed applications.
* All of the NEO Blockchain core components are written entirely using .NET, C# and Visual Studio including:

  * NEO Consensus Node
  * NEO Virtual Machine
  * NEO Transcompiler
  * NEO Debugger
  * NEO Source-code Level Execution Cost Profiler
  * NEO Developer's Wallet
  * NEO Smart Contract Visual Studio Extension

* C# is the reference language for developing smart contracts deployed on the NEO Blockchain.  Other languages such as Python, Java, JavaScript, and Golang are also support for smart contract development.

* C#, using the NEO Persistable Classes Platform, is the only NEO smart contract development environment capable to supporting enterprise-class distributed application development.

* The NEO Blockchain is currently the #2 programmable blockchain platform. However, Ethereum, the #1 programmable blockchain platform, has show-stopping limitations in terms of scalability, performance, and capability as an enterprise distributed applications platform as exemplified by the following quotations:

  > The Ethereum community, key developers and researchers and others have always recognized scalability as perhaps the single most important key technical challenge that needs to be solved in order for blockchain applications to reach mass adoption. Blockchain scalability is difficult primarily because a typical blockchain design requires every node in the network to process every transaction, which limits the transaction processing capacity of the entire system to the capacity of a single node.[Ethereum scalability research and development subsidy programs, Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum Founder](https://blog.ethereum.org/2018/01/02/ethereum-scalability-research-development-subsidy-programs/)

  > Ethereum is a *one-trick pony x 1500* because the Solidity language used for developing Ethereum smart contracts is only able to represent a simple, single entity per smart contract. [[NEO Blockchain Vancouver Meetup Kick-off Presentation, Slide 59, Michael Herman](https://github.com/mwherman2000/neo-csharpcoe/tree/master/events/2018-NEO-Blockchain-Vancouver)]

## Driving a Resurgence in Enterprise Adoption of Microsoft Azure, .NET, Visual Studio and C#

* Millennials have a high attraction the blockchain investing and trading [[CNBC: Cryptocurrencies are the 'greatest opportunity' to get millennials to trade: TD Ameritrade](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/08/cryptocurrencies-are-the-greatest-opportunity-to-get-millennials-to-trade-td-ameritrade.html)].

* Millennials Developers, as a category, have a huge attraction to blockchain software development. [[ComputerWorld: Blockchain jobs continue to explode, offer salary premiums](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3235972/it-careers/blockchain-jobs-continue-to-explode-offer-salary-premiums.html)]

   >Blockchain development is the second-hottest skill in the job market today, growing more than 200% since this time last year.

### *First Mover Advantage* in a New Market: Distributed Applications Development

* Blockchain development, specifically distributed applications and smart contract development, is a new innovator/early adopter market for developers and partners as well as enterprise organizations.  There is a huge *first mover advantage* for .NET and C# in this market by supporting and leveraging the NEO Blockchain as a platform.

   ![The Technology Adoption Curve](./images/TheTechAdoptionCurveHighlighted.png)

### The Best and Only Blockchain Platform developed entirely on .NET

* As reiterated above, the NEO Blockchain is the only programmable blockchain platform that written entirely in .NET and C# using Visual Studio.  This has multiple benefits:

   * C# is the reference language for developing smart contracts deployed on the NEO Blockchain. Visual Studio is the reference IDE for smart contract development. [[NEO Blockchain C# Developers Center of Excellence: NEO Blockchain Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers](https://github.com/mwherman2000/neo-dotnetquickstart/blob/master/README.md)]

   * .NET, C#, and Visual Studio are the tools used to create all of the NEO Blockchain's core components and all of these are open source projects on GitHub. This means that the same .NET, C# and Visual Studio skills and experience used to create NEO smart contracts can also be used to read, understand, and contribute to the NEO core components. For example, the NEO VM's `Execution Engine` is a straight-forward C# class that can be self-hosted in **any** .NET application like a script engine - even non-blockchain applications. [[The Neo Project (neo-project)](https://github.com/neo-project)]

     * NEO Consensus Node ([neo-cli](https://github.com/neo-project/neo-cli))
     * NEO Virtual Machine ([neo-vm](https://github.com/neo-project/neo-vm))
     * NEO Transcompiler ([neo-compiler](https://github.com/neo-project/neo-compiler))
     * NEO Debugger ([neo-debugger-tools](https://github.com/CityOfZion/neo-debugger-tools))
     * NEO Source-code Level Execution Cost Profiler ([neo-debugger-tools](https://github.com/CityOfZion/neo-debugger-tools))
     * NEO Developer's Wallet ([neo-gui-developer](https://github.com/CityOfZion/neo-gui-developer))
     * NEO Smart Contract Visual Studio Extension ([neo-devpack-dotnet](https://github.com/neo-project/neo-devpack-dotnet))

### The Best Blockchain Developer Tool Suite

* .NET, C#, Visual Studio, and the NEO Smart Contract Visual Studio Extension is the best developer tool suite for creating smart contracts - including seamless integration with the NEO Debugger.

* NEO was very clever in its integration with the Microsoft .NET compiler stack. NEO developers build what is essentially a Windows console application with `Main` method prototype that often looks something like `public static Object Main(string operation, params object[] args)` - but `Main` can take virtually any parameters and return any parameters (including simple types, an instance of a class, an array of instances of a class). 

* Smart contracts are built as plain-old C# class projects. The NEO Compiler is then run as a post-build step to transcompile MSIL patterns from the assembly (DLL file) into a .AVM NEO VM byte code file.

* All of the features of the Visual Studio IDE and .NET/C# environment are available include the .NET/C# optimizing compiler features which have been demonstrated to reduce NEO VM by 25%. This is a key capability because every NEO VM instruction executed is tracked and accounted for. ([NEO System Fees](http://docs.neo.org/en-us/sc/systemfees.html)).

### Enterprise Distributed Applications and Smart Data: Enabled by .NET and C#

What is unique about Enterprise Distributed Application development on a blockchain?  ...the NEO Blockchain or any other blockchain.

* While people talk mostly about *smart contracts* in the context of programmable blockchain development, it is really about *Smart Data* living on the public Internet (as well as private networks and consortium networks).  Smart Data that is both trustful and trustless.  Trustful because a transaction has been confirmed on the NEO Blockchain, it is there forever: unchangeable and irrefutable. ...free from any form of centralized control. Trustless because once confirmed on the blockchain, the Smart Data is digitally signed and completely decentralized.
* The only way to place data on the NEO Blockchain is to write a smart contract that will, via a NEO transaction, put it there for you. Every placement of data (C# entities) is wrapped in the code of some application's smart contract - digitally signed and deployed in the same way Smart Data is digitally signed and confirmed into the NEO Blockchain.

### Large Base of .NET and C# Developers

The Large Base of .NET and C# Developers = Huge Opportunity to create Resurgence in the Enterprise Adoption of Microsoft Azure, .NET, Visual Studio and C#.

* Incremental technology education, training, and adoption

* There are several million .NET developers worldwide - possibly close to 10 million in 2018.

   * >There are roughly 6 million professional developers worldwide, about 90% of whom target Windows. 4-5 million of those 6 million developers targeting Windows are Visual Basic developers. There are about 2.5 mln .NET developers. More than 60% of the Fortune 100 develop using .NET. Forrester says that 56% of enterprises in North America are choosing .NET for their development requirements vs. 44% choosing J2EE. [.NET developer statistics - a word from Microsoft, July 19, 2004](http://www.zdnet.com/article/net-developer-statistics-a-word-from-microsoft/)

   * >There are 3.1 million monthly active developers across all Microsoft products as of August 2016, of which 1.5 million C++ developers using Visual Studio and over 2 million .net developers (including C# of course), according to Amanda Silver ([MSDN: How Many Developers Use C++ vs. C# vs. Other Programming Languages, October 24, 2016](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/zxue/2016/10/24/how-many-developers-use-c-vs-c-vs-other-programming-languages/)).

* C# does not rank very high on most programming language surveys - typically, 5th place or less.
