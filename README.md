## What is a COE?

>A center of excellence (CoE) is a team, a shared facility or an entity that provides leadership, best practices, research, support and/or training for a focus area. ... A center of excellence may also be aimed at revitalizing stalled initiatives. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_excellence)
