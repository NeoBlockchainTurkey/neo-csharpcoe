NEO Persistable Classes (NPC e-dApp) Platform: NEO Blockchain Enterprise Application Competition #1

[NEO Blockchain C# Center of Excellence](https://github.com/mwherman2000/neo-csharpcoe/blob/master/README.md)

## What is the NEO Blockchain Enterprise Application Competition #1?

Co-sponsored by the [NEO Blockchain C# Developers Center of Excellence](https://github.com/mwherman2000/neo-csharpcoe/blob/master/README.md) ([neo-csharpcoe](https://github.com/mwherman2000/neo-csharpcoe/blob/master/README.md)), this contest is an unparalleled opportunity for teams to focus their creativity, passion, and ambition into building reusable enterprise applications on the NEO Blockchain.

## Two Award Categories: Best Enterprise Applications and Best Resuble Entities

1. **Best Enterprise Application** built using the NEO Persistable Classes (NPC e-dApp) Platform

   Juried competition to choose the best 3 enterprise applications built with the NEO Persistable Classes (NPC e-dApp) Platform.

   * Prizes will be awarded for first place, second place, and third place.
   * Submissions will be independently voted on and selected by 3 enteprise application specialists.
   * Submissions will be judged based on, but not limited to, the following criteria: 
      
      a) originality, 

      b) reusability and sharability of the application's components (smart contract as well as client-side patterns, entities, protocols, shared data, and other artefacts) across multiple projects - potential re-use and sharing  as well as actual reuse and sharing by other projects during the competition
      
      c) quality of your project's code, documentation, and videos

   **Best Enterprize Application - Submission Requirements**
   
   a. For smart contract/entity development, your project must use the NEO Persistable Classes (NPC e-dApp) Platform and NPC Compiler to create each entity

   b. Your project's client application and smart contract(s) must use *at least three (3) different entity classes*.
   
   c. Your project can develop its own entities and/or re-use any existing NPC entities found in the NPC Entity Gallery [TODO]. Your project can partner with other projects to share entities, functionality, and/or deployed smart contracts (including shared data). One NPC entity will be supplied in advance: `NPCCounter`. Use of `NPCounter` is optional.
   
   d. You can use any .NET technology for your client-side application: ASP.NET, WinForms, WPF, Windows Console Application, Windows Service, Azure Web Jobs, etc.

   **NOTE:** Re-use and sharing across projects is highly encouraged.

2. **Developers Choice Awards: Best Reusable Entities** built using the NEO Persistable Classes (NPC e-dApp) Platform

   * NPC Reusable Entities will be voted on by any developer who enters the NEO Blockchain Enterprise Application Competition: Best Enteprise Application category and/or Best Reusable Entity category. 
   * The ten (10) NPC Reusable Entities with the most votes will win prizes.
   * When voting for the Best Resuable Entities, developers are asked to keep the following criteria in mind: 
      
      a) originality, 

      b) reusability of an entity (smart contract patterns, entities, protocols, shared data, and other artefacts) across multiple projects
      
      c) quality of the entity's code, documentation, and videos

   **Developers Choice Awards: Best Reusable Entities -  Submission Requirements**
   
   a. For smart contract/entity development, your project must use the NEO Persistable Classes (NPC e-dApp) Platform and NPC Compiler to create each entity

   b. Each of your entity's functions must successfully and reliably execute using 10 Gas or less.
   
   c. If you want to submit a Reusable Entity without developing a submission for the Best Enterprise Application category, this is possible as long as someone else's project uses your entity as part of their submission.
   
   **NOTE:** Re-use and sharing of Reusable Entities across ,multiple projects is encouraged.
